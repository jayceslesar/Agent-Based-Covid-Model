TODO 10/7 ?:
    Agent:
        Track number of people infected: Done
        Infectiveness per agent -> distribution? (introvert/extrovert)

    Model/Space:
        Probabilities:
            Threshold to be a spreader/asymptomatic
            How long to go from Exposure -> infected
            DO: Distance between agents
            Neighborhood (constraints on how far interactions spread)
            Boundaries:
                Adjacent -> define -> north south or corners as well?
                Corners/Edges -> if time

    Swapping:
        Choose who is swapped (right now it is random so anyone)
        Number of swaps per step? Swapping rate? (swaps per turn)


TODO 10/7 actually:
    NEEDS_WORK:: Neighborhood size per cell -> radius of infectivity

    TODO:: Make swap customizeable:
        Swap recovered person with uninfected person to move recovered closer to infection?
        Time delay for contact tracing -> ?
    DONE:: Visuals with PyGame
    DONE:: Radius -> function/vectorize
    DONE:: Boundaries -> add flag for corners and not corners

    WAIT:: Add flag for wrap/sphere (implementing this will cause a lot of things to break) -> will need to add many if clauses in lots of places


TODO 10/14
    TODO:: realtime stats graph

    TODO:: Make swap customizeable:
            Pick someone recovered and swap with who has not been infected and is near an infected person
            Time delay for contact tracing -> ?

    WAIT:: More realism in interactions....radius, *aersol*, droplets

    WAIT:: redo in C++ because it is slow
        confirm everything works in python and then port it to C++ to run the simulations

    TODO:: fix run conditions:
        run until no infections, stop run if no infections or initial infection is not spreadable

    TODO:: when to update in the step and grab stats

    TODO:: code cleanup (comments, explicit names, ect)

    TODO:: realism (many aspects)

    TODO:: CPP implementation ?
